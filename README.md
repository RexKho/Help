# [Help](https://help-j278.onrender.com)

## About

Help is a clone of an early version of a review page like [yelp](https://www.yelp.com/). It allows users to view and write reviews for businessess that may interest them. With help, users will be able to see and add their own reviews of businesses around them.

## Technologies

Help was built using Ruby on Rails as the backend, React-Redux as the front end and PostgresSQL as the database management system. The review star, sign up, and log in/out icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com). The Logo is from [Logo.com](https://logo.com/).

## Features

Businessess will populate on the splash page where users can select one to view. On the business show page, users will be able to add a review to the business. A review can only be edited and deleted by the author who created it. Each Review also has a rating associated with it that can be edited as well. 

### Review CRUD

### Rating Associated with each Review/Business

## Future Plans
 - Google maps API integration for each Business
 - Photo upload for each review
 - Star rating implementation
 - Business account that can create a business
